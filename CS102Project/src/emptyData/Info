Having lots of topics to learn, students may feel overwhelmed sometimes.
Learning new topics and comprehending them properly can be a challenge for them. 
That’s why my team decided to create an application to make students’ life easier. 
The main goal of this project is to simplify the perception of topics by students, 
crushing the time to collect complete information and demoing all topics in the most easy-to-understand way.
Our team, consisting of only students who recently were in the role of learners of these topics,
decided to sum our opinions and experiences collected in the past and compose an application that will teach us,
make practice and then test our knowledge. 
We have united all learning styles and concluded them in “perfect” one to make our application unique
and at the same time flexible. We hope our project will serve a large number of students and keep their
knowledge and grades at top.
